It predominantly provides services for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Such services include assessing children for ASD, providing initial training for children with ASD, involving parents, speech therapy services for a limited number of children, conducting awareness programs for preschool teachers and public, and facilitating knowledge sharing locally with the help of visiting experts. Considering the limited resources, there is always a place for volunteers in this center when it comes to  services provision, as well as other activities, including documenting the center’s services, promoting autism awareness, and creating teaching and learning materials to be used in the training of the children as well as their parents. Worked as a photographer and a storyteller to document the activities of the center, as well as to produce videos to create awareness about autism. Also involved in the production of training materials for the children and parents.           Website: https://www.mathavam.org",
